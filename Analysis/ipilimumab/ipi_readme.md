Ipilimumab is the first case study in ERNIE. The FDA approved its use on 3/25/2011. The process involves

a) Assemble initial documents: 
   i. go to drugs@fda and saerch ipilimumab. Copy bla, date of approval, brand name.
   ii. Download Medical Review document
   iii. Using drugbank.ca, Google, Google Patents and any other web source identify a single US patent that best represents the original invention 
   for the therapaeutic or intervention or diagnostic etc. 
   iv. DOwnload the patent document from Google Patents.

b) Assemble lists of pmids from each data source. 

   i. Patent: Copy the non-patent literature citations on Google Patents for this patent and manually parse them in PubMed to get a list of pmids. 
   For ipilimumab, pmids were found for all 52 citations as in <npl_pmid></npl_pmid>> For patent number use <pl_USPatentno> </pl_USPatentno>

   ii. Clinical Trials. Search for ipilimumab or Yervoy in the interventions field of ct_clinical_studies in ERNIE. Tag each clinical trial with completion
   date (year). 381 distinct nct_ids were found along with 278 and 10 pmids from ct_references and ct_publications respectively. These pmids are filtered
   by cut-off date (below), which is 2011 in this case.

   select nct_id,pmid  from ct_references and ct_publications where nct_id in (select nct_id, start_date, completion_date, SUBSTRING(completion_date 
   FROM '.{4}$') as year_of_completion from ct_clinical_studies where nct_id in (select distinct nct_id from ct_interventions where lower(intervention_name) 
   like '%ipilimumab%' or lower(intervention_name) like '%yervoy%') order by year_of_completion);

    By convention (revised in Jan 2018),  Dec 31, 2011 is the cut-off date for pre-approval to post-approval. This comes with its own set of issues 
    because of the difference between approval in Jan 2011 and Dec 2011 for example but it is what it is. Thus, get all pubs and references and filter 
    them by <= 2011 before including them in the seedset.

    iii. FDA. From the medical review document, scrape any cited references and find pmids for them in PubMed (manually till we have a better way). Use
    <fda_medical_review_pmid> </fda_medical_review_pmid>. For ipilimumab there was only one reference. If you find any other useful references such as 
    in the summary review use <fda_other_pmid> </fda_other_pmid>.

    iii. PubMed. 

    Again using the preapp and postapp convention (actual approval date is 3/25/2011) at 12/31/2011 conduct PubMed searches.

    Preapp: (("ipilimumab"[Supplementary Concept] OR "ipilimumab"[All Fields]) OR ("ipilimumab"[Supplementary Concept] OR "ipilimumab"[All Fields] 
    OR "yervoy"[All Fields])) AND ("1900/01/01"[PDAT] : "2011/12/31"[PDAT]) tag as <pubmed_preapp_pmid> </pubmed_preapp_pmid>

    Reviews: To capture reviews published a year post-approval (((("ipilimumab"[Supplementary Concept] OR "ipilimumab"[All Fields]) 
    OR ("ipilimumab"[Supplementary Concept] OR "ipilimumab"[All Fields] OR "yervoy"[All Fields])) 
    AND ("2011/12/31"[PDAT] : "2012/12/31"[PDAT])) AND "review"[Publication Type]) AND "english"[Language]
    tag as <pubmed_reviews_pmid> </pubmed_reviews_pmid> 

    A workflow is then generated using Jenkins that applies a publication year cutoff to the seedset (union of ct, pubmed, patents, cited references from 
    reviews, fda) using data from Web of Science. Cited references are then extracted and four files are pased to the Java network analyzer that generates
    five output files.

    An ipilimumab.xml file is also constructed using descriptive tags, that is compliant with a DTD (seedset.dtd) which can be found on the Github repo.

Latest Run: Build 126. 1/19/2018 using ipilimumab_seedset_pmid_presql and ipilimumab_reviews_pmid_presql and cutoff parameter of 2011.
