This case study is about identifying the collaboration network connected to
the Affymetrix expression profiling kit. Unlike drug case studies, which
are easily defined in terms of being pinnacle events with approvals, 
patent awards, successful clinical trials as filters of sorts, this one
is a little more difficult to think about. However...

a) Core technology: appears to be Fodor's 1991 Science paper
b) Device approval: Affymetrix GeneCHip System 3000DX
c) Diagnostic kit: Roche Amplichip CYP450 & Luminex kit
d) Applications: Drug metabolism studies
e) Policy links: TBD
f) PubMed: 2C19 and 2D6 literature- should other genes be added? 
g) Psychiatric drug literature- which cytochrome P450?
h) Affymetrix publication database scrapes
