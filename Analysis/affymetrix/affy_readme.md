Affymetrix Amplichip CYP is the fourth case study in ERNIE. This is an unusual case study in that involves looking at inventions from two independent manufacturers as well as 
discovery. Thus, our canonical workflow has to be modified as well as the XML spec. A second tweak is greater reliance on WoS data for the backbone.

a) FDA: List relevant 510ks
b) Patents: List Affymax and Affymetrix patents
c) Fodor's papers, Pirrung's review, and Garfield's Microarray historiography could form a root cluster for papers.
d) Clinical Trials: Not clear that any are relevant
e) Cytochrome P450 drug metabolism literature 
f) NIDA support for 2D6 and 2C19 research
g) Expression profiling for CYP450
h) Citing and cited references using Jan 2005 as a reference date (Jan 2006 for publication lag). Why?
