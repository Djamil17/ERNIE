This README describes the purpose of each file in this folder.

Co-cited pairs were generated from year-slices in Scopus, i.e., publications of type article with at least 5 cited references.
Only those references with complete records, i.e., also present in the scopus_publications table were included and issns 
were required for both publications and references. The reason for this is that these year slices were designed to support
citation switching experiments using an MCMC approach (Uzzi et al. 2013, Bradley et al 2020) and frequencies were computed at 
the journal level (issn).

neo4j_calculations.sh -> Runs on neo4j server to calculate kinetics, first_co_cited year calculations
theta_omega_calculations.sh -> theta omega sql calculations, writes them to table cc2.theta_omega_delta_results
theta_omega.sql and theta_omega_calculations.sql are files related to theta omega sql calculations
sb_calculations.py -> sleeping beauty calculations

Tables:
cc2.theta_omega_delta_results -> table to which theta omega calculations are written
(would advice to move data to a new table after each run and truncate this table, chance of duplicate cited_1,cited_2 pairs occuring
if not truncated.)
cc2.ten_year_cocit_union_freq11_freqsum_bins -> main table with all 33 million pairs
cc2.co_citation_10_plus -> refdiff,mindiff,maxdiff data for all pairs with scopus_frequency >= 10

kinetics_data -> kinetics data for pairs with scopus_frequency >= 50
sb_results -> sleeping beauty calculations for pairs with scopus_frequency >= 50
