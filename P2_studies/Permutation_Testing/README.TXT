# 3/22/2019 The scripts in this folder all relate to data prep and analysis for 
# the co-citation analysis project that is largely inspired by a combination of
# our experience with the data in ERNIE and the Science paper in 2013 by Uzzi et al.

1) Jenkins job: /P2_studies/Permutation_Testing/uz_ds.sql- generates year slices of the WoS dataset selecting publications of type Article and retaining only those references that have complete records in the wos_publications table in our PostgreSQL schema.
2) Permutation script: permute_script.R permutes the multi-set of references grouped by publications and reference year.
3) SWR script: bg_swr_recursive_dedupe.R: implements the background model using sampling with replacement
4) frequencies.R: calculates the frequency of citation (number of times it has been cited) within a year slice
5) probtest.R: generates kvals and pairs.csv to implement Warnow's closed form solution of the background model
6) observed_frequency.py: generates journal pair frequencies for the year slices of the WoS dataset
7) background_frequency.py: generates journal pair frequencies for the background model implemented using permute and swr
8) journal_count.py: Joins all permute,swr files generated by background_frequency and calculates mean,std and z-scores.
9) Table_generator.py: Final output file which contains all publications, reference pairs along with observed frequency and z-scores.

The workflow is 

1) generate year slice
2) generate background models if going the MCMC route
3) calculate frequencies 
4) calculate kvals and pairs for closed form solutions
