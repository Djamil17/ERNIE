# July 25, 2018. NET ESolutions. email:netelabs@nete.com The five Python 2.x scripts in this folder were 
# used to connect to various Scopus APIs as part of a collaboration with Abt Associates on an independent project 
# for the National Science Foundation. For these scripts to be useful, an API key is needed and the script
# should be executed from a machine with a whitelisted IP address. The process involves
# searching for AuthorIDs using "first_name last_name" queries and then using those AuthorIDs to 
# retrieve Documents and Affiliation information. Reading the Elsevier documentation is highly recommended. 
# https://dev.elsevier.com In addition, we push the csv output from these scripts to a PostgreSQL database
# and can share the details of that process if there's interest.

a) This script uses strings from stdin and queries SCOPUS author search for the top 10 author results. Input must come in the form 
"name,award_number,first_year" where 'name' is in the form "first_name last_name"

b) ScopusInterface.py: This script interfaces with various Scopus APIs including the author, abstract, and affiliation retrieval APIs
as well as the SCOPUS search API. A subset of the XML fields are returned in python dictionary format. Due to limited bandwidth at the
API end, it is important to ensure the sleep_time variable is set to a value which does not cause the API to choke on response.

c) collect_affiliation_profiles.py: This script utilizes the ScopusInterface script, item a) above, to populate *affiliation* profile related 
CSV files based on API HTML responses.

d) collect_author_profiles.py:  This script utilizes the ScopusInterface script, item a) above, to populate *author* profile related CSV files 
based on API HTML responses.

e) collect_document_profiles.py: This script utilizes the ScopusInterface script, item a) above, to populate *document* profile related CSV files 
based on API HTML responses.
