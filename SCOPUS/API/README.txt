# The five Python 2.x scripts in this folder are 
# used to connect to various Scopus APIs as part of a collaborative effort with Abt Associates on a project 
# for the US National Science Foundation. For these scripts to be useful, an API key is needed and the script
# should be executed from a machine with a whitelisted IP address. The basic strategy is to 
# search for AuthorIDs using "first_name last_name" queries and then use retrieved AuthorIDs to 
# retrieve Documents and Affiliations. To prevent overwrites, we push the output from these scripts to a 
# PostgreSQL database as its generated and can share the details of that process if there's interest.
# Reading Elsevier's documentation is very helpful and highly recommended.

a) scopus_query.py: This script uses strings from stdin and queries SCOPUS author search for the top 10 author results. Input must come in the form "name,award_number,first_year" where 'name' is in the form "first_name last_name"

b) ScopusInterface.py: This script interfaces with various Scopus APIs including the author, abstract, and affiliation retrieval APIs
as well as the SCOPUS search API. A subset of the XML fields are returned in python dictionary format. Due to limited bandwidth at the
API end, it is important to ensure the sleep_time variable is set to a value which does not cause the API to choke on response.

c) collect_affiliation_profiles.py: This script utilizes the ScopusInterface script, item a) above, to populate *affiliation* profile related 
CSV files based on API HTML responses.

d) collect_author_profiles.py:  This script utilizes the ScopusInterface script, item a) above, to populate *author* profile related CSV files 
based on API HTML responses.

e) collect_document_profiles.py: This script utilizes the ScopusInterface script, item a) above, to populate *document* profile related CSV files 
based on API HTML responses.
