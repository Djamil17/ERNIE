 Title: Scopus-update TAP-test
 Author: Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina
 Date: 07/23/2019
 Purpose: Develop a TAP protocol to test if the scopus_update parser is behaving as intended.
 TAP protocol specifies that you determine a set of assertions with binary-semantics. The assertion is evaluated either true or false.
 The evaluation should allow the client or user to understand what the problem is and to serve as a guide for diagnostics.

 The assertions to test are:
 1. do all tables exist
 2. do all tables have a pk
 3. do all the tables have a lexis_tblspc
 4. do any of the tables have columns that are 100% NULL
 5. For various tables was there an increase?
