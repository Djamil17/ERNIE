-- This script updates the Clinical Trial (CT) tables in the following way:
-- 1. Keep the newest version: new_ct_table_name;
-- 2. Insert rows from the previous version (ct_table_name) that have nct_ids
--   not in the newest version.
-- 3. Drop the oldest backup version tables: old_ct_table_name.
-- 4. Rename tables: ct_table_name to old_ct_table_name;
--                  new_ct_table_name to ct_table_name.
-- 5. Update the log table.
-- The CT tables always have two version: ct_table_name as the current tables,
-- and old_ct_table_name as backup for previous version.
