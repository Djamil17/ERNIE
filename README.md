# Welcome to ERNIE

This draft document will take form through 2017.

Enhanced Research Network Informatics Environment (ERNIE) is a knowledge platform in which data relevant to  research 
evaluation are integrated. ERNIE enables the documentation of discovery networks and influential nodes within them. In 
this first phase of development, ERNIE will be tested with case studies spanning drug development, medical 
devices/diagnostics, behavioral interventions, and solutions for drug discovery. The focus of these case studies is 
substance abuse and results will be posted at the earliest. 

Emphasis is placed on the use of Open Source technologies. At present, ERNIE resides in a PostgreSQL 9.6 database in a 
Centos 7.3 VM in the Microsoft Azure cloud. The data in ERNIE are drawn through a variety of ETL processes from both 
publicly available and commercial sources. ERNIE is being developed by NET ESolutions Corporation (NETE). As of 
Feb 1, 2018 the project has been active for 4.5 months. Initial server infrastructure has been set up, core data 
have been scraped, leased, parsed, loaded, and partially curated and illustrative case studies are under way. The project team will add additional data sources as and when they become available. 

This project has been funded in part  with Federal funds from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, National 
Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract No. HHSN271201700053C.
