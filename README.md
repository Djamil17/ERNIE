# Welcome to ERNIE

This draft document will take form through 2017.

Enhanced Research Network Informatics Environment (ERNIE) is a knowledge platform that integrates data sources relevant to 
research evaluation and enables the documentation of discovery networks and influential nodes within them. In this first 
phase of development, the platform will be tested with case studies spanning drug development, medical devices/diagnostics, 
behavioral interventions, and a drug discovery platform. Emphasis is placed on the use of Open Source technologies. At present, 
ERNIE resides in a PostgreSQL 9.6 database in a Centos 7.3 environment in the Microsoft Azure cloud. ERNIE is being developed 
by NET ESolutions Corporation (NETE). This project has been funded in whole or part  with Federal funds from the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract No. HHSN271201700053C.

On October 15, 2017 the project has been active for a month. The initial server infrastructure is complete and core data have been loaded. A set of case studies is being conducted to test and validate infrastructure and data respectively, as well as to explore new problems.
