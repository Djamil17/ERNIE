# Welcome to ERNIE

This draft document will take form through 2017.

Enhanced Research Network Informatics Environment (ERNIE) is a knowledge platform that integrates data sources relevant to 
research evaluation and enables the documentation of discovery networks and influential nodes within them. In this first 
phase of development, the platform will be tested with case studies spanning drug development, medical devices/diagnostics, 
behavioral interventions, and a drug discovery platform. Emphasis is placed on the use of Open Source technologies. At present, 
ERNIE resides in a PostgreSQL 9.6 database in a Centos 7.3 environment in the Microsoft Azure cloud. ERNIE is being developed 
by NET ESolutions Corporation (NETE). As of October 15, 2017 the project has been active for a month. Initial server infrastructure has been set up and core data have been loaded. The data in ERNIE are drawn from publicly availably and commercial sources and the project team will add additional data sources as and when they become available.  A set of case studies is being conducted to test and validate infrastructure and data respectively, as well as to explore new problems. The focus of these case studies is substance abuse and the results will be posted at the earliest.

This project has been funded in whole or part  with Federal funds from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract No. HHSN271201700053C.
