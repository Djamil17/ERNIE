Title: Email Parser-Downloader-Tester
Author: Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina
Date: 06/24/2019


The point of this parser is to take an email and scan it for url.
Once the url is found it opens it up and saves it to a specified directory.
This is code for an automated process which will leverage Jenkins to set off a process when
triggered by the reception of an email with a url-link.

Example link:
