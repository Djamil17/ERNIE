\begin{abstract}

Data mining of public and commercially available data sources coupled with network analysis has been used as a digital methodology to document and analyze collaboration and knowledge flow in the development of a drug. This approach is extensible to research evaluation problems in any scientific area that can be defined by a nucleus of publications with accessible citation records. However, a tradeoff exists between exhaustive manual curation by experts and automated `big-data' methods. The former is less scalable, the latter can be less accurate. We have developed Enhanced Research Network Information Environment (ERNIE), a cloud-based knowledge platform that integrates free data drawn from public sources as well as licensed data from commercially available ones. ERNIE is built using Open Source tools, is easily replicated and modified, and its modular design enables the facile addition of new data sources and deletion or substitution of existing ones. Data in ERNIE can be accessed using search technologies or Structured Query Language (SQL). To demonstrate the capabilities of ERNIE we present the results of seven case studies that span drug development, pharmacogenomics, behavioral interventions, and opioid addiction. In these studies, we mine and analyze data from policy documents, regulatory approvals, research grants, bibliographic and patent databases as well as  clinical trials to document collaborations and identify influential research accomplishments.

\caption{{\bf Intersecting Publications in Five Networks} Intersections were calculated across all five networks for the first generation of references (citing\_pmids) and 
as well as for the second generation of references (cited\_sids) and displayed as Venn diagrams. \emph{Left Panel.} No first generation publications are observed common to all five networks. A single publication is cited in four of five networks. \emph{Right Panel.} 14  publications are common to all five networks. Abbreviations: alem (Alemtuzumab), imat (Imatinib), nela (Nelarabine), ramu (Ramucirumab), suni(Sunitinib)}

\caption{{\bf Core Publications in Networks}  The outer arcs of blue nodes identifies first generation publications (citing\_sid) for each therapeutic. Nodes in the inner ring are sized by a gradient proportion to total degree count with an upper limit of 30 and are colored by a gradient proportional to the number of drug connections (2 to 5). 14  publications are common to all five networks (Table 3) and are colored red. The remaining nodes in the inner ring connect to between 2 and 4 drugs each and are labeled accordingly. Abbreviations: alem (Alemtuzumab), imat (Imatinib), nela (Nelarabine), ramu (Ramucirumab), suni(Sunitinib).}
