\begin{abstract}

Data mining of public and commercially available data sources coupled with network analysis has been successfully used as a digital methodology to study research collaborations and knowledge flow associated with drug development. To enable quantitative studies based on this approach, we have developed Enhanced Research Network Information Environment (ERNIE), a scalable cloud-based knowledge platform that integrates free data drawn from public sources as well as licensed data from commercially available ones. Analytical workflows in ERNIE are partially automated to enable expert input at critical stages. To facilitate adoption, reuse and extensibility, ERNIE was built with open source tools. and a modular design enables the facile addition, deletion, or substitution of data sources. To demonstrate the capabilities of ERNIE, we report the results of seven case studies that span drug development, pharmacogenomics, target discovery, behavioral interventions, and opioid addiction. In these studies, we mine and analyze data from policy documents, regulatory approvals, research grants, bibliographic and patent databases, and clinical trials, to document collaborations and identify influential research accomplishments. ERNIE is a template for repositories that can be used to support expert qualitative assessments, while offering burden reduction through automation and access to integrated data.

\section*{Introduction}

The risk of research evaluation being driven by data and metrics with insufficient consideration of balanced judgment has driven the formulation of  sound principles to advise practice~\cite{LeidenManifesto2015}. However, data are still critical for evaluation, and utilitarian approaches for capture, integration, and archival that offer coverage and burden reduction assist the practice of research evaluation. While bibliographic data is usually central to research evaluation, the use of administrative records such as government statistics and research funding offers complementary value~\cite{FedStat2017}.

Using data mining of publicly available administrative, regulatory, and scientific records and network analysis, Williams and colleagues defined relationships between scientific discoveries and major advances in medicine such as new drugs~\cite{Williams2015}. Extending this work, we have previously documented the scientific collaborations that extend across networks underlying the development of five independently developed therapeutics for cancer~\cite{Keserci2017}. Analysis of such networks supports new insights into collaboration, knowledge diffusion, and recursive learning \textit{( videsupra)}. The framework we developed to mine data and integrate it into networks for analysis incorporates expert input, is flexible , can be further automated, adapted to a range of subjects beyond drug development, and used to support individual researchers, groups, and research organizations engaged in research assessment. In addition, cloud computing and data science have evolved to the point where scalable computing services and analytical methods are accessible to a broad user population. Thus, we have developed Enhanced Research Network Informatics Environment (ERNIE), a knowledge platform that integrates publicly available data as well as data from commercial sources.

In demonstration that is focused on the theme of data mining and network analysis, we have used the data within ERNIE to conduct seven case studies. In these studies, we mine and analyze data from policy documents, regulatory approvals, research grants, bibliographic and patent databases, and clinical trials, to document collaborations and identify influential research accomplishments. The workflows used incorporate expert knowledge into defining a set of core documents from which citations can be extracted, linked to other records in ERNIE, and analyzed. The first two case studies serve to validate ERNIE through reproducing the results of prior studies~\cite{Williams2015} on ivacaftor and ipilimumab, breakthrough drugs used to treat cystic fibrosis and melanoma. The remaining case studies concern two drugs used to treat opioid addiction~\cite{Blumberg1973,Cowan1977} , a microarray system for pharmacogenomic profiling~\cite{deLeon2006}, a target discovery system originating from enzyme fragment complementation assays~\cite{Khanna1989}, and a behavioral intervention for substance abuse~\cite{Botvin1980}. The datasets that result from these studies are made available for use by other researchers and the workflows used to generate them are also archived to permit reproduction of our results, as well as review and modification of the methods used to generate them.

\section*{Materials and Methods}

\emph{Infrastructure} ERNIE runs on two CentOS 7.4 Linux servers in the Microsoft Azure cloud with 10 terabytes of attached storage. One server, Azure standard D8s v3 (8 VCPUs, 32 Gb RAM), hosts data in a PostgreSQL 9.6 relational database, and additionally acts as a central hub for data related processes. A second server, an Azure standard DS4 (8 VCPUs, 28 Gb), runs Apache Solr 7.1 search server, which is used to to create and store indexes of ERNIE data to facilitate fast free-text user searches. Access to ERNIE servers is secured through SSH tunneling and two-factor authentication, with a unique time-based code acting as one of the factors. 

\emph{Data sources} Data in ERNIE are extracted from both publicly available and commercial sources. Publicly available data are copied from the National Clinical Trials Database \cite,  the FDA Orange and Purple Books \cite, the United States Patent Office \cite, and NIH ExPORTER \cite. Leased data are acquired from Clarivate Analytics and consist of the Web of Science Core Collection and the Derwent World Patent Index~\cite{DWPI2017}. The data in ERNIE are stored in a relational schema that is documented. Documentation is available on GitHub. Custom Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) scripts are developed in Bash, Python, Java and SQL. Automated processes are managed by the Jenkins Continuous Integration server, which is additionally used to deploy scripts dedicated to data transformation, direct construction of Solr indexes as new data is introduced into ERNIE, and build citation networks for case studies. Solr indexes can handle varying forms of Lucene-based search and full-text search, and quickly return informative, ranked, and scored query results so that a user may be able to map data across sources. The citation networks are sub-networks (based largely in the Web of Science) that are generated based upon user input and subsequently analyzed. All ERNIE code is shared as open-source under the MIT license and is available on GitHub ~\cite{GithubERNIE2017}.

\emph{Data architecture and governance} ERNIE data is extracted from several upstream sources of varying quality and the  approach to cleansing is to prefer data quality and normalized data over data completeness. The following are key aspects of ERNIE's data architecture and governance. (i) De-duplication to eliminate logically duplicate records, that is records with identical primary or unique keys. In ERNIE duplicate records from such a group are deleted while leaving in place a single representative record (preferring a record which is updated last) (ii) Normalization to establish foreign key relationships between children and parent entities and eliminate orphans: child records with non-existing parents. )iii) Schema permanence to improve availability of data and simplify data schema management (iv) Data Stewardship to assign responsibility for quality of a particular data subject area. Data stewards are notified when a data issue is detected and drive the workflows necessary for data issue remediation. They are also typically responsible for communicating changes in data structures.

\emph{Workflows} The core workflow in ERNIE consists of (i) Source document identification, in which a set of source documents relevant to the question being asked is assembled  (ii) Citation extraction, in which text references to scientific publications and patents are matched to unique identifiers such as PubMed ID, UT (Web of Science Accession Number), or US patent number.  (iii) Amplification, in which publications and patents linked by citation to extracted references are identified through citation records in the Web of Science (iv) Network analysis, in which the data assembled through the preceding stages are represented as a network and influential nodes are identified (v) Visualization of the network data to provide insight and stimulate further investigation.

\emph {Source document identification} A set of source documents relevant to the question being asked is assembled and mined for citations to scientific literature using manual or semi-automated methods. 

\emph {Citation extraction and matching} Manual extraction involves searching for text strings that represent references of interest and matching those to unique identifiers in PubMed and/or Web of Science. For example, the medical review document relevant to approval of ipilimumab contained X references. Y of them were matched to PubMed identifiers using the PubMed either through its web interface or the E-utils API. ERNIE is designed to support semi-automated case studies.
