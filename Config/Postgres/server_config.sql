This parameter controls the average number of object locks allocated for each transaction; individual transactions can

Sets the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory buffers. The default is typically 128 megabytes

If you have a dedicated database server with 1GB or more of RAM, a reasonable starting value for shared_buffers is 25%
of the memory in your system. There are some workloads where even large settings for shared_buffers are effective, but
because PostgreSQL also relies on the operating system cache, it is unlikely that an allocation of more than 40% of RAM
to shared_buffers will work better than a smaller amount.

/*
Sets the planner's estimate of the cost of a non-sequentially-fetched disk page. The default is 4.0.
This value can be overridden for tables and indexes in a particular tablespace by setting the tablespace parameter of
the same name (see ALTER TABLESPACE).

Reducing this value relative to seq_page_cost will cause the system to prefer index scans; raising it will make index
scans look relatively more expensive. You can raise or lower both values together to change the importance of disk
I/O costs relative to CPU costs.

Random access to mechanical disk storage is normally much more expensive than four times sequential access. However,
a lower default is used (4.0) because the majority of random accesses to disk, such as indexed reads, are assumed to be
in cache. The default value can be thought of as modeling random access as 40 times slower than sequential, while
expecting 90% of random reads to be cached.

If you believe a 90% cache rate is an incorrect assumption for your workload, you can increase random_page_cost to
better reflect the true cost of random storage reads. Correspondingly, if your data is likely to be completely in cache,
such as when the database is smaller than the total server memory, decreasing random_page_cost can be appropriate.
Storage that has a low random read cost relative to sequential, e.g. solid-state drives, might also be better modeled
with a lower value for random_page_cost.
